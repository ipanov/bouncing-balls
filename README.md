# Bouncing balls

Bouncing balls is an application spanning balls on each mouse click event using an HTML5 Canvas.
Balls are affected by gravity and friction and have a predetermined elasticity.
Let's asume that the balls are moving on different planes along an imaginary z-axis so the possibility of them coliding is exluded.
